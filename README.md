### Test by Blocking Network Requests in Chrome

To test the extension and force a tag to error, you can utilize the built-in network request blocking feature available in the Chrome DevTools.

1. Start the Tag Assistant using the preview function in GTM.
2. Go to the tab that was opened with your website, right-click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect" to open the Chrome DevTools.
3. In the DevTools panel, click the kebab menu >  More Tools > Network request blocking

4. Configure the blocking rules by adding URL patterns for the requests you want to block. For example, you can enter "*google.com" and "*analytics" to block all requests to the Google domain.

5. Reload the page to apply the blocking rules, then check tag assistant. You should see any tags that have failed highlighted in red.
